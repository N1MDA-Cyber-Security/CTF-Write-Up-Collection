Because the main goal of this challenge is how to use the web inspector or inspect element from web page, let's check the Home page first.
After checking the source code of Home page using inspect element, there're no other clues regarding the flag.

Then let's check the About page. In this page, there's something strange from the `notify_true` attribute in `section` tag.
It's seems the value of this `notify_true` is encoded using base64.

After decoding the value of `notify_true` using [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) we will get the flag for this challenge.
